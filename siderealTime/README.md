## Sidereal Time

`sidereal.py`: python script that applies algorithm 5.3 from the book Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students to calculate local sidereal time from date, time, and east longitude of the site.

`SiderealGUI.py`: streamlit web app that takes input and uses the functions in `sidereal.py` to calculate the sidereal time.

The streamlit web app is hosted [here](https://orbital-sidereal-time.streamlit.app).
