## Gibbs' Method

`gibbs.py`: python script that applies algorithm 5.1 from the book Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students to calculate the 6 classical orbital elements from 3 coplanar position vectors.

`GibbsGUI.py`: streamlit web app that takes 3 position vectors as input and uses the functions in `gibbs.py` to calculate the 6 COEs.

The streamlit web app is hosted [here](https://orbital-gibbs-method.streamlit.app).
